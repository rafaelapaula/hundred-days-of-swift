 Access control
 https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/0/19/access-control
 
 MARK: The default access level in Swift is internal. That means that any class you define in your code can be accessed from within your app's module, and not outside of it. This is a sensible default: you want to restrict your code to your module, and not allow outside access.
 
 * Public: this means everyone can read and write the property.
 * Internal: this means only your Swift code can read and write the property. If you ship your code as a framework for others to use, they wonâ€™t be able to read the property.
 * File Private: this means that only Swift code in the same file as the type can read and write the property.
 * Private: this is the most restrictive option, and means the property is available only inside methods that belong to the type, or its extensions.
