 Variables and constants
 https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/0/2/variables-and-constants
 
 One of the advantages of separating constants and variables is that Xcode will tell us if weâ€™ve made a mistake. If we say, "make this date a constant, because I know it will never change" then 10 lines later try to change it, Xcode will refuse to build our app.
